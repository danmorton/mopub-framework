Mopub iOS Framework Build
=============

This project allows us to build an universal static framework for iOS.

Created by following:
``` https://github.com/jverkoey/iOS-Framework ```

Current Mopub SDK Version:
--------------------------
	3.7.0

Current Networks Adapters:
--------------------------------
- AdColony
- Chartboost
- Facebook
- GoogleAdMobs
- Greystripe
- iAd
- InMobi
- Millenial
- Vungle

*Note:* ***Greystripe*** not supported as it requires ```AddressBook.framework``` and ```AddressBookUI.framework```. Which has resulted in rejections.

*Note:* All current networks will require the SDK's in your project.

TODO
----
- pull repo directly from mopub.
